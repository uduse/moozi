# R2D3 - R2D2 from Demonstrations

This folder contains an implementation of the R2D3 agent introduced in
([Paine et al., 2019]). This work builds upon the R2D2 algorithm
([Kapturowski et al., 2019]).

In this case a learner similar to the one used in R2D2 receives batches with a
fixed proportion of replay buffer and demonstration data.
